# Hi, my name is James
<p>I am mainly interested in datascience and I will be using this as a space to show my progress over the course of the next year. 
I experience with deep learning including generative adversarial networks and computer-vision but hoping to apply this more broadly and experiment with other concepts such as NLP. </p>
